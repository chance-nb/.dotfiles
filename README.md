# my .dotfiles
these are mostly here for my own convinience, if anyone wants to use them, go ahead, but stuff might be changed and/or broken at any time (also good luck with the hypr setup, it's barely functional).

# needed things (other than the things themselves)
fish:
```eza```

nvim:
```unzip npm gcc```

kitty:
```ttf-jetbrains-mono-nerd``` (named differently on almost every distro, so has to be reconfigured)

hyprland:
```dunst waybar pipewire wireplumber polkit-kde-agent qt6-wayland qt5-wayland greetd regreet cage noto-ttf xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland kitty brightnessctl wofi``` (again this is only half-functional)
